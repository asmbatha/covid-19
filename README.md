### Prerequisite
Make sure you have the following installed on your computer.

* Docker
* Nodejs
* Python3

# Getting started
```bash
sh start.sh
```

In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of this repo and simply run `sh start.sh`.  

Be patient as we set up the database, api, and client.
The web app should open automatically on your browser.  
If you don't get any results in you first try, we may have started the application before the database was. run `sh start.sh` once more and all should be fixed.ðŸ™ƒ
